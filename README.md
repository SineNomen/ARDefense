AR Defense is a simple proof-of-concept prototype for an Augmented Reality Tower defense style game.



## How to Play

Point the camera at the ground and move around slowly until the game recognizes the ground as a plane.
Then, move the reticule around to "grow" the ground plane, when the reticule is green, press the confirm button
to start the game. For best results, pay outdoors with as large an area as is comfortable to move about.

Currently, Only Android is supported.
